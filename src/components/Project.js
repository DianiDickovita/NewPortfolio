                {/* <p>The "Information Management System for Apparel Factory" is a comprehensive web-based 
                    application designed to revolutionize and optimize the operational 
                    landscape of the apparel manufacturing industry, with a specific 
                    focus on the esteemed RLF Apparel Factory in Sri Lanka. At its core,
                    the project seeks to address the inefficiencies associated with 
                    traditional manual methods prevalent in garment factories. 
                    The system aims to introduce a sophisticated and integrated 
                    solution that spans the entire spectrum of apparel manufacturing,
                    encompassing crucial functionalities such as inventory management,
                    employee roles, customer interactions, and supply chain coordination.</p>
                <p>The system boasts a multifaceted set of functionalities
                    tailored to the diverse roles within the apparel factory.
                    Actors include the Manager, Fashion Designer, Merchandiser,
                    Customer, and Suppliers. The Manager, serving as the system
                    administrator, has the privilege of managing users, 
                    raw materials, costume designs, and overseeing the 
                    entire employee hierarchy. Fashion Designers can 
                    efficiently manage costume designs, while Merchandisers
                     handle quotations, orders, and payments. Customers, after 
                    signing up, can explore costume designs, request
                    customized designs, and place orders based on quotations
                    received. Suppliers, on the other hand, can view raw 
                    materials, send quotations, and handle purchase requests.
                    The system's architecture facilitates seamless 
                    communication and coordination among these actors,
                    enhancing overall operational efficiency and customer
                    satisfaction.</p> */}
